# Instructions
The purpose of this mini assignment is to provide you with an opportunity to digest the class material through hands-on exercises. 
<br><br>

**To complete this assignment, follow the directions below:**  

1. Choose two categories of businesses. See the [Yelp API documentation](https://docs.developer.yelp.com/docs/resources-categories) if you need help with the choice.  
    * Because you will have Yelp business information for two different categories, you may need to merge them into a single data frame by using bind_rows().
    
2. Choose a county within the US. Use tidycensus package to download Census Tract polygons.

3. Write R codes to get business data from Yelp using yelpr package for the selected county & business categories. Make sure you leave comments using hash tags (#) to explain what each code chunk is doing.

4. Map the locations of business using the downloaded data.

5. Answer the following questions:
    * What's the county and state of your choice?
    * How many businesses are there in total?
    * How many businesses are there for each business category?
    *	Upon visual inspection, can you see any noticeable spatial patterns to the way they are distributed across the county (e.g., clustering of businesses at some parts of the county)?
    *	(Optional) Are there any other interesting findings?


# Logistics
1. Write your report and R code in a R Markdown document. 
2. Use the Knit button in R Studio to render it as a HTML document.
3. Publish the rendered document to RPubs.
4. <font color="pink">Submit the URL of the RPubs document through Canvas by **9/20/2024 Friday midnight (11:59 PM on Friday).** </font>
5. To submit, go to Canvas > Assignments > Mini assignment 1.
6. Grades and feedback will be posted through Canvas.



    
# Notes
Try Knitting your R Markdown document and publishing it on RPubs early. This is to ensure you'd have time to troubleshoot if you encounter technical issues.

You can always replace a published document (i.e., republish) or delete the existing one and publish it as a new document.
