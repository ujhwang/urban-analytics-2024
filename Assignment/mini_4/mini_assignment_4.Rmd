# Instructions
**Point of Interests**

Point-of-interests (POI) are important for urban residents in various ways. POIs can add economic and social vitality to the neighborhood in which they locate. POIs that are close to residential locations can functions as destinations that people can potentially walk to, creating more walkable environment; in fact, Walk Score of a location is calculated based on how many/diverse POIs are found within the walkable distance from that location. **These benefits are likely to be greater if POIs are attractive and popular**. 

However, attractive POIs may not be distributed evenly across different neighborhoods; we anecdotally know that attractive POIs are more likely to be found in more advantaged neighborhoods, and more advantaged neighborhoods may enjoy more benefits from having attractive POIs nearby than their counterparts.

**Research Question**

**But is there really such relationships between the attractiveness of POIs in a neighborhood and being advantaged as a neighborhood? Which neighborhood characteristic has the strongest relationship with the attractiveness of POIs?** This assignment aims to examine the relationship between being advantaged as a neighborhood and having more attractive POIs using ggplot package.



**To complete this assignment, follow the directions below:**

1. Download the data prepared for this assignment from [here](https://ujhwang.github.io/urban-analytics-2024/Assignment/mini_4/coffee.csv). This data was prepared using the following steps:
    * Yelp data was downloaded for categories = 'coffee'. This data covers Fulton, DeKalb, Clayton, Cobb, and Gwinnett counties. 
    * American Community Survey 5-Year Estimate for 2019 was downloaded for the counties specified above. It contains 
        (1) median annual household income (hhincome)
        (2) percent residents under poverty (pct_pov)
        (3) percent residents who self-identify as white (pct_white)
        (4) total population (pop). 
        (5) log-transformed version of median annual household income (hhincome_log)
        (6) log-transformed version of percent residents under poverty (pct_pov_log)
    * The two data are spatially joined. After joining, a few additional columns were generated, including 
        (1) the total number of businesses (yelp_n)
        (2) average rating (avg_rating)
        (3) average number of reviews (review_count)
        (4) log of the average number of reviews (review_count_log)
        (5) average price (avg_price)

2. Using this data, re-create the following plots as closely as possible. Make sure you provide the code you wrote to generate the plot. When you re-create them, you DO NOT need to make plots aesthetics similar. For example, 
    * When custom colors are used, the choice of colors does not matter as long as you appropriately use some custom colors of your choice to display the designated data; 
    * When opacity is used, the actual level of opacity doesn't matter as long as a reasonable level of opacity is applied. 
    * Other minor aesthetics, such as the aspect ratio and theme of the plots, do not matter. If you want to modify them for aesthetics, feel free to do so.
    
3. For each of the plot, write a few sentences to describe your findings.


**Plot 1.**   
Variables used - avg_rating, hhincome
![plot 1](q1.jpg)
 
**Plot 2.**   
Variables used - avg_rating, hhincome, county
![plot 2](q2.jpg)

**Plot 3.**   
Variables used - review_count_log, hhincome, county, pct_white
![plot 3](q3.jpg)

**Plot 4.**  
Variables used - pct_pov_log, hhincome, pct_white, pop, review_count_log, county
![plot 4](q4.jpg)
***Hint**: I used pivot_longer() to create Plot 4.*


# Logistics
1. Write your report and R code in a R Markdown document. 
2. Use the Knit button in R Studio to render it as a HTML document.
3. Publish the rendered document to RPubs.
4. <font color="pink">Submit the URL of the RPubs document through Canvas by **10/11/2024 Friday midnight (11:59 PM on Friday).** </font>
5. To submit, go to Canvas > Assignments > Mini assignment 4.
6. Grades and feedback will be posted through Canvas.



    
# Notes
Try Knitting your R Markdown document and publishing it on RPubs early. This is to ensure you'd have time to troubleshoot if you encounter technical issues.

You can always replace a published document (i.e., republish) or delete the existing one and publish it as a new document.
