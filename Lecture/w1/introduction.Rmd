# What is Urban Analytics?

--

###Application of <b>Big data</b> and <b>data science tools</b> to understand, monitor, and control urban functions and processes

--

###Michael Goodchild defines it as a 'new kind of urban research, one that exploits the vast new sources that are becoming available from social media, crowd sourcing, and sensor networks...'

--

###'Urban analytics is fast emerging as the core set of tools employed to deal with problems of big data, urban simulation, and geodemographics' -- Michael Batty

##Analytics is the discovery, interpretation, and communication of meaningful patterns in data' --Wikipedia

# Deliverables and Grading Breakdown
* Only four out of the five mini assignments will be counted towards the final grade. 
* The team project presentation is based on PowerPoint slides (or other presentation tool of your choice.) 
* The team project report should be a web document rendered from R Markdown (or other tool of your choice).

```{r echo=F}
data.frame('Assignment Type' = c('Mini Assignments (4 out of 5)', 
                                 'Major Assignments (3 out of 3)', 
                                 "Team Project Presentation & Report",
                                 "Participation"),
           'Percent' = c("20% (5% each x 4)", 
                         "45% (15% each x 3)", 
                         "30%",
                         "5%")) %>% 
  kbl() %>% 
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("condensed", "responsive"))
