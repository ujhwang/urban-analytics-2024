2020-08-11,1597177999,My antivax mom started crying after I said I didn't want to associate with anti-vax protesters and threatened not to help me pay for college if I got a flu shot.,"So, to preface, I (17F) am an incoming freshman in college. I'm going to a UC (won't say which for obvious reasons), but I got into the school's semi-competitive engineering program and it was one of my top choices for college. I absolutely love the school. Unfortunately, the UC system just instituted a new rule that all students need to get a flu shot before they can attend. My mom (50F) has been incredibly upset about this for the past two days.

She called me up about an hour ago to talk about how I wanted to ""deal"" with the problem of having to get a flu shot.

She was asking me to reconsider going to another college halfway across the country because they don't require flu shots. The school is not nearly as good in terms of engineering, it's a long way away and it's expensive as hell for out of state students. I have zero desire to go there. I told her this wasn't the hill I wanted to die on, I don't think getting a flu shot is really that big of a deal and I certainly don't want it to be the reason I end up not going my top choice college.

She got kinda angry with me and basically implied that she wouldn't pay for me to attend college if I got the shot, I would be completely on my own.

Then she said, ""Why don't you march your protester self (I organized a BLM march in our city back in June, so she's referencing that) down to city hall. I'm sure you can find people who will protest with you.""

And I responded, ""I'm not sure I want to associate with those people,"" which I know was super mean and sounds awful to me in hindsight. She started crying and hung up on me after I said that.

My mom and I seem to be at odds about everything right now. She was upset with me for organizing the BLM march, she doesn't like most of my political views, and she's even threatened to burn a book I was reading by Richard Dawkins about evolution because ""he advocated for cannibalism"" (???) and she seems to vaguely think evolution is a lie, despite not be religious so far as I can tell.  I also had to get a series of vaccinations in ninth grade to attend my high school, which my dad took me to get and which my mom is still extremely upset about almost four years later. I feel like this whole disaster is going to be the final straw though.

I just really need some advice on how to deal with this before she comes home from work and gets super mad and starts yelling at me.

Edit: Okay, I just want to add because people keep suggesting this, I can't exactly go behind her back here and get the shot on my own. Like, physically yes I can walk to Walgreens and get it. But being allowed to go to college = got the flu shot. She will know, and therein lies the problem. Also, I know my mom sounds kinda bad on paper (or ""on Reddit"") but she really is a loving and caring person who is attempting to look out for me in her own way, so please stop with the name-calling. I came here asking for help, not asking you to shit on my mom. It's just not helpful or productive. Thanks.

Edit 2: Just want to let everyone know that I am reading every single one of your comments. I want to answer everyone's questions, but that might take a while as I'm still working out how to deal with this situation with my dad. Thanks to the people who have been helpful, supportive, and encouraging with their advice.

DH the most fucked up part about this is that she said three referees out two kids in his team sick DH she knew. she KNEW BIL2  was exposed to all those sick people. and she STILL asked you to bring LO over. DH she doesnt care about her or what could happen to her. 

and he was like i know 

so i was like nope im not doing it anymore. she needs to finally be called out on not respecting us. shes done ENTIRELY too much. im not letting you rug sweep this this time. so he grew his spine. he sent her this :

Hey if you dont agree with our parenting choices thats fine.  Were her parents so we get to make these decisions. No one has to agree with them because shes not their child. We dont think its cool that you agree to respect our rules, and then complain about them or try to tell us were wrong. Because thats not really respecting them. Both times you have agreed, but youve also blocked me, tried to guilt trip me, basically said the rules shouldnt apply to you, and tried to tell us nothing we do will work. No one else seems to have an issue with our rules. We told you your actions would prove to us if you respected us as parents and based on your actions it seems like you dont. At the end of the day shes our daughter and you can either support and actually respect us or not be in her life. Im tired of the passive aggressiveness and the guilt trips. And if you think Ive been distant maybe its because of they way these things are handled time and time again. Things cant continue like this, its too exhausting mentally. Things either need to change or we will excuse ourself all together. Again I want a relationship with you, but you have to treat me like an adult. Im allowed to have feelings and decision of my own. Im sorry if this message hurts your feelings but my little family is my number one priority. 


she said exactly what rules have i broken? What did i do? I told you that the boys were sick and that i was glad you did not come over to carve pumpkins what actions have i taken to make you think that?

so he said We never said you broke any rules. You havent. Its your actions that have caused us to feel this way. You do agree to respect our rules. But your actions after you say that  show us that you dont respect us as parents.


man. she TATTLED to her husband. 


so FIL (sweet sweet just very much yes fil) texted DH and was like hey can i call you? i promise i wont lecture you

so we were like yeah ok lets go

so DH talked on the phone and i listened in. and seriously? this man gets it. 100%. 

apparently he sat her down after she tattled to him and they had a LONG conversation about how shes fucking wrong. 


on the phone he was likei completely understand where youre coming from. i read over all the messages from the past two days and youre completely right. we dont have to agree with your choices we can think theyre dumb or great or whatever but it doesnt matter. what matters is that its what you guys think is best for your family and we need to say okay. She doesnt have to like it but if shes gonna bitch she can do it to me not yall or on facebook because it doesnt matter what she thinks.  I think she still want to be you mom, which she is, but she needs to treat you like an adult because you are one. She hasnt gotten that through her head yet. I told her that the only people who matter to you right now is you, OP and LO. that is your main focus and it should be. just like her main focus should be the four people who live in our house. Youre not intrested in the boys sports or what we do everyday and you dont care.You shouldnt. Thats not important to you, whats important is your family. She needs to back off. She has an overwhelming desire to be apart of your life and she doesnt want to get pushed out. she said she doesnt want to stop inviting yall over because she doesnt want yall to feel like your not welcome. But i dont think thats ever going to be the case. She is pushing so hard that shes pushing you all away and she needs to stop before its over. I think that yall have gotten to the point where everything that has happened even back from 12-18 months ago has just piled up and its snowballed until now. i know yall had to adress it because it needs to stop.i dont really know what to do from here.  i think the best thing to do for now is if yall want to come over or have something to say to us you probably send it through me and i can relay it to her or set it all up. I think honestly if we could start from a clean slate it would be for the best.

so there it is. FIL gets it and pretty much put her in her place. we can only hope the message stuck. she hasnt messaged him at all in the past two days ( she normally send him a ridiculous amount) so thats good i guesss. i told DH I cant start with a clean slate without an apology.",JUSTNOMIL,91,https://www.reddit.com/r/JUSTNOMIL/comments/dl0us2/mitm_flu_shot_edition_update_dh_got_his_shiney/

Backstory: MIL is antivaxx. Shes never had a vaccination in her life and shes perfectly healthy, says the woman who is always complaining about being under the weather (rant for a different day). Luckily smart SIL, that married in before me, made her get the Tdap before their first born arrived. Since that was about 5 years ago, I didnt need to broach the subject with her when we found out I was pregnant. DD was born in March, so I didnt push the flu shot on anybody beings it was the tail end of flu season (and I was super strict on visitors).

Cut to today: I told DH before we went over that he was going to have to address the flu shot issue with his parents, since that time of year is approaching and we have a 7 month old now. I have the opinion that my DDs life is far more important than someones feelings on vaccines. No flu shot, no holding my baby after November 1st. Sorry, not sorry.

DH: Hey, so you guys get your flu shot yet?

JYFIL: Nope, I dont believe in those.

MIL playing deaf and doesnt acknowledge anything was asked of her. 

DH: Id pry consider getting one if I were you.

Me to DH as we were leaving: Theyre gonna be real upset when I dont let them hold the baby after November 1st.

DH: Yep. Sucks for them.

2022-11-26,1669477747,Flu shot,"I'm struggling with the decision of whether or not to get vaccinated against the flu. The main counter argument for me is that the production of the flu vaccine involves eggs (apparently one egg yields about three shots, if that matters, but I can't find any reliable information on it), and hence is not vegan.

""Obviously I won't take the flu shot"" was my initial reaction to finding out this information. Given that I'm not particularly at risk, and neither am I frequently exposed to people that are, this seems like a reasonable vegan stance to take. However, what makes this decision non-obvious for me, is that getting infected and spreading the disease might cause a lot more harm than the flu shot (both to humans that could get hospitalized, and to non-human animals exploited during the production and testing of the medication sick humans receive).

This seems to be a trolley problem sort of situation, where one needs to decide between doing active harm to a chicken, or doing (potential) passive harm to more animals.

Do you think the distinction between the two kinds of harm is relevant? Is it worth digging up the relevant data and estimating the ""expected value of harm"" (if that's even quantifiable) or will it not affect your opinion?

I'd love to hear your thoughts on this, even if it's just whether or not you are going to take the flu shot.

EDIT: Thanks everyone for voicing your opinions. You convinced me to look for a vegan alternative (although I was under the impression that there was none), and if I can't find it, I'll just get the flu shot they have.",vegan,53,https://www.reddit.com/r/vegan/comments/z5al6y/flu_shot/

2017-10-04,1507117421,YSK: A flu shot isn't just for you. It protects people who can't get a flu shot.,"Every year around this time, you see reminders to get your flu vaccine, and every year, a bunch of people don't do it, for one reason or another. ""I never get the flu anyway."" ""The flu shot makes me sick, so why bother?"" ""It doesn't even work, so what's the point?""

The point is that in addition to protecting *you* against the most common strains of the flu each year, we need a critical mass of people to get vaccinated to prevent the flu from spreading at all, so people that *can't* get the vaccine - the very young, elderly, or immunocompromised - are protected, too. This is super important, since this is the group most likely to suffer serious complications if they get the flu, including death. 

[This is called ""herd immunity,"" or ""community immunity.""](https://www.vaccines.gov/basics/protection/index.html) The point is that [if a high enough percentage of people are immune, there are too few susceptible people for the virus (that was a typo, thank you) to spread.](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f5/Herd_immunity.svg/512px-Herd_immunity.svg.png) We've successfully done this with diseases like measles and mumps ([except where anti-vaccers have caused outbreaks](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/to-your-health/wp/2017/10/03/failure-to-vaccinate-is-likely-driver-of-u-s-measles-outbreaks-report-says/)). 

So YSK, get a flu shot, because it'll probably keep you from getting the flu, and grandma needs you to get the flu shot so *she* doesn't get the flu when you sneeze in the supermarket. Grandmas and newborns everywhere thank you. 

&amp;nbsp;

**Edit:**

Just to clear up a few things.

The flu vaccine [varies in effectiveness](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/professionals/vaccination/effectiveness-studies.htm) from year to year, based on how well it matches the circulating strains of influenza, but generally goes a good job reducing your risk of becoming sick with the flu by 40-50%. Each year, the vaccine protects against three strains, and [a lot of work](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/season/vaccine-selection.htm) goes in to determining which strains are most likely to be common. It isn't just guesswork. 

&amp;nbsp;

That doesn't sound effective enough to want to get the vaccine? Here's a more important number: The CDC estimates there are about 20 to 30 THOUSAND flu-associated deaths a year, on average, mostly from secondary respiratory infections like pneumonia. But to see what a big deal the vaccine makes, we can compare a ""good"" year and a ""bad"" year. The ""bad"" year was 2004, when the vaccine was largely ineffective. There were about 45,000 flu-associated deaths that year. The ""good"" year, oddly enough, was 2009, the year H1N1 scared everyone, with about 15,000 deaths.

Why the difference? No vaccine in 2004, but a very effective vaccine and higher-than-normal vaccination rates in 2009. 

It works. Save lives. Get your flu shot. 

&amp;nbsp;

2019-10-15,1571126240,WIBTA: If I refuse to get a flu shot to hang out with my GF's friends,"My gf wants to host a game night, but one of her friends has a newborn(4weeks old). The parents want everyone to have their flu shots before they bring the kid over. Maybe it's because I(30yr M) grew up before flu shots were a thing, but I don't feel that I should be required to have a shot to hang out with them. If they are worried about their kid they should get a sitter and leave him at home.

My gf got pissed and said I was being unreasonable because the flu shot was inexpensive and you can easily get them at a CVS. I am all about vaccinations, but I am not a fan of being told I need to do something for someone else's peace of mind.

Edit:

Quick edit, that I thought was obvious. I am not going to go if the baby will be there, and I don't have my shot. I don't want to get a baby sick/possibly die. I may still be the A\*\*hole, but I am not heartless.

2019-12-13,1576243329,"YSK: in the US more people died from the flu in 2018 than from opiates during the worst year of the ""opiate epidemic"" (2017). Go get your flu shot.","In 2018 the us had 80,000 deaths as a result of flu complications while the during the worst year of the opiate epidemic (2017 so far) deaths from opiate overdose were just over 70,000. Additionally, on top of deaths there were hundreds of thousands of hospital visits, millions in economic losses as a result of the flu. Furthermore this was even the worst flu recorded in history(50 million deaths from the 1918 flu world wide).
So go out and get your vaccine, it's not too late and it could save your or prevent you from spreading it to children and elderly (most at risk).

Also I want to point out that I am not trying to play down the opiate epidemic, these are both serious problems, I just used it to highlight how important the flu is as most people acknowledge the opiate epidemic but ignore the yearly flu epidemic. Also, of you are struggling with opiates please seek help it's not too late, here is a link that can assist you.  https://www.samhsa.gov/find-help/national-helpline



Lastly for those interested in learning more about vaccination here is a link to the podcast ""this week in virology""  on which a panel of R1 researchers address and debunk many of the common antivax myths. It's a tad long but VERY informative, and interesting. Plus it would be hard to find a better source of info on the topic that's easily accessible

Twiv496 ""Vaccines work, whether or not you believe in them"" -&gt;http://www.microbe.tv/twiv/twiv-496/


Also before the antivaxer begin attacking, I challenge you to find one thing factually in accurate in podcast episode. If you can prove, with valid sources, that the professors have said something wrong I will remove this post.

Edit: the reason ""opiate epidemic"" is in quotations is because the definition of an epidemic is ""a widespread occurrence of an infectious disease in a community at a particular time"". Opiates are not infectious and do not properly fit the description hence the quotes. I gave resources to help people and clarified that I am not down playing the seriousness of the problem.

Edit2:   The amount of pseudo science being promoted in this thread is absurd. Just to clarify every one is suceptible the flu, unless you have memory to the virus and because of frequent mutations this only last for about a year. Also yes OBVIOUSLY the elderly are more at risk then the general public but young children and occasionally perfectly healthy adults can have very intense reactions. Also for the people who won't die from the flu(or are unlikely to) there are many many other negative impacts, such as loss of work hospitalization and just feeling like shit for a long period of time. ALSO the flu shot CANNOT give you the flu. True it's not always the most effective but even when it's not very effective it can shorten how long you are sick , decrease the symptoms, and you will produce less viral particles.",YouShouldKnow,1286,https://www.reddit.com/r/YouShouldKnow/comments/ea3x5g/ysk_in_the_us_more_people_died_from_the_flu_in/

2019-10-19,1571471454,"UPDATE: No flu shot, no holding the baby >7<û@","First, thank you to this amazing community. Ive been watching from the shadows for awhile, commiserating with the headaches that are JNMILs. While mine may mainly just be BEC moments, its nice to have somewhere to vent with like minded people.

Now my previous post wasnt meant to turn into a debate on vaccinations. I have my opinions based on science and experience in the healthcare field. Others are entitled to different opinions, but those people also have to understand there are consequences for their decisions.

The unfortunate situation Ive come into is that my daughter is the 7th grandchild and no one before me has ever addressed the flu shot issue (as previously mentioned, JYSIL did make them get the Tdap before the oldest grandchild was born and that was about 5 years ago). DHs opinion on the entire situation is that medicine isnt his area of expertise, so he defers to me for those situations. So whatever I say, goes.

Now onto today. I was having a conversation with a friend that is due with her first in December about the whole adults and vaccinations issue. She felt like she was going crazy trying to think of everyone who may want to see her little one after birth. Having just recently gone through that myself, I decided to make the following post on social media, so I dont have to actively reach out to every single person that may have contact with my DD:

Since that time of year is quickly approaching, this is just a friendly reminder for everyone:
Dont take it personally if you are not allowed to hold someones baby because you made the choice not to get the flu shot this season.
Thats the great thing about freedom of choice, were all allowed to make them.
You choose not to get the flu shot and I choose not to let those people have contact with my infant daughter.
Her life is far more important to me than your opinions.

Also, just because this needs to be said as well:
Dont kiss babies that arent yours.
Not their faces.
Not their heads.
Not their hands.
Not their feet.

Protect those who cant protect themselves.

Not even an hour later, MIL is calling DH in a tizzy because she doesnt do vaccinations and shes never got any in her life. DH kindly reminded her she got her Tdap before nephew was born and thats why we didnt even bring it up before DD was born. Were not making them get it, but visits with DD will be extremely limited, if they happen at all. She of course had to get off the phone because she was so emotional.

Lord help me.


Edit: Forgot to add that JNSIL (DHs younger sister) is due with her 2nd at the beginning of December and MIL is going to be way more hands on with that baby. So even if she wont do it for my daughter, Id hope shed do it that little one.",JUSTNOMIL,210,https://www.reddit.com/r/JUSTNOMIL/comments/dk0obs/update_no_flu_shot_no_holding_the_baby/

2021-11-15,1636983355,"MIL told us she had the flu shot, but lied, just to see newborn","Long time lurker here. My husband (28m) and I (30f) are FTP and just had our newborn son (8 weeks). He was born at 35 weeks due to preeclampsia, hypertensive crisis via emergency c section. He spent 8 days in the NICU on C-pap and oral feeding tube due to respiratory distress. We have asked all grandparents to get Covid, Tdap, and flu shots before meeting our newborn. With all of these, they may hold our newborn as long as they wear masks and wash their hands. My parents and 17 year old little brother are fully on board and have supported all of our decisions. My husbands family, on the other hand, have been difficult. His family are covid vaccinated though. His father does not think he needs flu/tdap to see his grandchild to which we respect his decision but therefore he must respect ours and not see the baby until the baby can be vaccinated. He understood. 

His sister (26f) also believes this as well but is less understanding. She is pushy and holds a grudge. For example, she texts us saying if I dont see the baby, no presents for the baby and our favorite, if I dont see the baby, I will not hang out with you or my brother anymore. I am not even 100% convinced she truly got the covid shot because of her anti-Vaxxer rhetoric, but per MIL, they both did. 

He has an older brother (31m) who has a two year old child and he does not have the flu shot or tdap vaccine. Older brother did not ask their parents for these requirements when his baby was born (ok, to each their own). 

DH mother (my dear MIL) agreed to have Tdap and flu vaccine (wow!) or so we thought&

My husband asked her multiple times if she had the shots. She said yes and we agreed for her to visit. Everything started on a good note. She forgot her mask but no worries, we have extra! So she masked up and washed her hands and alas, she finally got to hold her newborn grandson.

Then we got into a discussion how she was angry at older brothers wife because wife gave their kid the flu shot. I calmly asked why &.and this is when I learned that she doesnt believe in the flu shot because kids have natural immunity, doctors are never 100% right, she does her own research, she is not currently sick with the flu &.and oh then I asked, wait, did you get your flu shot and she casually replied No, I am not sick.

I looked at my husband and before I could even say a thing, he said to me she told me she got it&.

I tried to educate her& oh, my doctor reccomends, safety of the baby, he was a preemie in the nicu, respiratory distress&. But was met with you are being so rude. I do not need flu shot because I am not sick and you are overreacting. I got the Tdap/covid and thats enough.

This is when my husband intervened and thankfully, we are 100% on the same page. I take the baby to our room and remove myself from the situation before I flip my shit. I was already getting so mad, ears hot and my tone of voice raising. I loudly told husband I want your mother to leave now.

MIL leaves and as per husband, she is crying what if I die before I see grandson again, but I dont have insurance and the flu shot isnt free for me, your wife has beef with me and is purposely withholding grandchild and our favorite your wife has postpartum depression, look at how she reacted.

So end of story, she isnt coming back to where she isnt welcomed -her words. Husband is getting messages from his sister that if we treat her the way we treated MIL, she will not be seeing us or baby anytime soon. 

So AITA for asking MIL to leave because she didnt get the flu shot?

Edit: Thank you everyone for replying. I guess I know that I am not the asshole. Not sure why I feel like one though. You have all helped me feel empowered in my decision and now I can rest my head a little easier.

I have decided to go no contact with the in laws. I feel relieved and less stressed/anxious.

2022-01-15,1642218170,"The reason you only need one flu shot a year isnt because flu vaccine lasts a year, its because the flu season only lasts a few months","Ok I keep seeing people say Covid vax isnt like flu vax because flu vaccine lasts a year 

Thats not true.

Both covid vax and flu vaxs strongest protection only lasts a few months. (Tho covid protection against severe disease and death seems to last longer)

But for flu, the flu season is short and you only need protection for part of the year. 

Covid is continuous at the moment which is why we need to keep boosting.

If flu was not as strongly seasonal and was as bad all year round, you would need about 3 flu shots a year to be protected. 

We know this because people who get their flu shots very early in the season (like march) can need boosters to maintain protection through the worst of the flu season in august. 

(Edit: the more common example is that people who are going to the northern hemisphere after our flu season and before theirs are recommended to get another flu shot, even if only a few months have passed)

If covid eventually settles into a strongly seasonal pattern (and theres some suggestion it will), we will probably only need to boost just before that season, because well only need high levels of protection during the few months of covid season. 


Note carefully: This is a separate issue to the fact that both covid and flu evolve quickly, which means that flu vaccines (and probably eventually covid vaccines) need to be redesigned every year to match circulating strains.",CoronavirusDownunder,370,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoronavirusDownunder/comments/s4axxu/the_reason_you_only_need_one_flu_shot_a_year_isnt/

She texted me today and told me that her husband is insisting that anyone who sees the kids has to have had their flu shot. I totally understand, however I have never gotten the flu shot, and never intend to get it. 

So, AITA for then telling her that I am unable to help with the babies now since I am against the flu shot? Her reply to me was pretty cold and I feel terrible. I dont like to say no to anyone.

EDIT TO ANSWER A COMMON QUESTION HERE: I have not gotten a flu shot ever because I have never had the flu, never had the shot..so I just never have. When I went to my doctor a few months ago, I mentioned that I was considering getting it before an upcoming vacation. He told me that it will most likely give me flu-like symptoms for a few days, and to hold off.

***LAST EDIT: ***Alright, I am a major asshole. Im getting the shot at Kaisers flu clinic after work today. Even if I feel funny or something after, its a small price to pay if I get to see those babies and help my friend in need. Thank you all, I feel so bad. Im glad I posted - sometimes you need other people to call you on your shit.

2021-08-24,1629829802,Flu shots for toddlers?,"Do you guys get your toddler a flu shot every year? I have a two-year-old, and I am considering taking him to the local pharmacy to get a flu shot soon. Im a little worried he will have no context for what we are doing and why. He gets his vaccines at the doctors office, but hes not crazy about the process. Seems like a huge hassle to go through with him. My parents didnt do a yearly flu shot with me until I was in middle or high school, so I am wondering how common it is at the toddler age. Please dont comment that I SHOULD do it, only whether you do it with your toddlers or not and how the process goes for your little. Do they cope well? And if you do, how do you explain it to your little tiny ones who wont understand? Thank you!",toddlers,397,https://www.reddit.com/r/toddlers/comments/pat7c1/flu_shots_for_toddlers/
