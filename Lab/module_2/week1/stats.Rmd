# To answer the question we need to first determine what data we need

Since we will be only using cross-sectional data (i.e., data from one period of time) we are limited in examining dynamics. You would probably look for change in several variables over the years to do a proper analysis of this questions!

But given this example of using data to seek some preliminary answers to the questions and strengthen a hypothesis, let's consider the following data:
1. Yoga Studios in Fulton and Dekalb Counties (already downloaded)
2. Neighborhood parameters (household income, racial make up, home values? Change in home values? Rental values?)

In this example I am hypothesizing that household income, racial mix, housing costs, and real estate taxes will have something to say about gentrification
So, I will first download my data for the most recent year from Census


```{r, results="hide"}
FD_tract <- suppressMessages(
  get_acs(geography = "tract", # or "block group", "county", "state" etc.
          state = "GA",
          county = c("Fulton", "Dekalb"),
          variables = c(hhincome = 'B19019_001',
                        race.tot = "B02001_001",
                        race.white = "B02001_002",
                        race.black = "B02001_003",
                        trans.total = "B08006_001",
                        trans.car = "B08006_002",
                        trans.drovealone = "B08006_003",
                        trans.carpooled = "B08006_004", # Notice that I was not interested in 005-007 (2 person/ 4 person carpool etc.)
                        trans.pubtrans = "B08006_008", # Did not want to download any details about the type of public transport (009-0013)
                        trans.bicycle = "B08006_014",
                        trans.walk = "B08006_015",
                        trans.WfH = "B08006_017",
                        med_housexp = "B25104_001",
                        med_realestate_taxes = "B25103_001"
          ),
          year = 2020,
          survey = "acs5", # American Community Survey 5-year estimate
          geometry = TRUE, # returns sf objects
          output = "wide") # wide vs. long
)

```

The data contains several redundant columns that we will not use. So, let's subset the data to only have the columns we will use

```{r, message=FALSE}
FD_tract <- FD_tract %>%
  select(GEOID,
         hhincome = hhincomeE, # New name = old name
         race.tot = race.totE,
         race.white = race.whiteE,
         race.black = race.blackE,
         trans.total = trans.totalE,
         trans.car = trans.carE,
         trans.drovealone = trans.drovealoneE,
         trans.carpooled = trans.carpooledE,
         trans.pubtrans = trans.pubtransE,
         trans.bicycle = trans.bicycleE,
         trans.walk = trans.walkE,
         trans.WfH = trans.WfHE,
         Med_HHExp = med_housexpE,
         med_RETaxes = med_realestate_taxesE)
```

# Let's display what we have!

```{r, message=FALSE}
tmap_mode("view")
## tmap mode set to interactive viewing
RE_Taxes <- tm_shape(FD_tract) + tm_polygons("med_RETaxes")
HH_exp <- tm_shape(FD_tract) + tm_polygons("Med_HHExp")
tmap_arrange(RE_Taxes, HH_exp)
```
  
  
# Now download the Yelp data. This has been done for you.

**To save time in class, we will use the Yelp data that is already downloaded for today's class.**

This data is for Fulton and DeKalb County, GA, and contains Yelp data with categories = "yoga". This data is already cleaned. To read the data into R, we will use read_rds() function in readr package.

```{r}
# Reading the yelp data
yelp_in <- read_rds("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ujhwang/UrbanAnalytics2023/main/Lab/module_2/week1/yelp_in.rds")
```

# I like to constantly check my datasets to see if the results look fine
I will check the file and then display it (i.e., the point locations of Yoga Studios) on the census data 

```{r}
skim(yelp_in)
tm_shape(yelp_in) + tm_dots(col="red") + tm_shape(FD_tract) + tm_borders()
```


# Appending Census data
Joining census data in this case is somewhat different from earlier. We will do the following:
1. make sure the projection (CRS) of both files are correct
2. Calculate how many yoga studios are within each census tract (there will be many tracts with 0 studios)
3. Join the two files with the count of Yoga studios

```{r}
## Check to see that the CRS for both the sf files are the same
head(FD_tract)
head(yelp_in)

## It turns out they are NOT! So we need to transform their CRS into the same
FD_tract_Geom <- st_transform(FD_tract, crs=4326)
Yelp_in_Geom <- st_transform(yelp_in, crs=4326)

Yoga_in_tract <- st_join(FD_tract_Geom, Yelp_in_Geom, join = st_intersects)
skim(Yoga_in_tract)

# Now count the Yoga Studios by tract
yoga_count_tract <- count(as_tibble(Yoga_in_tract), GEOID) %>%
  print()

# Join tract geometry with the number of Yoga studios in tract
test <- st_join(FD_tract_Geom, Yelp_in_Geom %>% mutate(count = 1))
out <- test %>%
  group_by(GEOID) %>%
  summarise(count = sum(count, na.rm = T))

# Lets' check to see if the polygons and the poin data on Yoga Studios match
tm_shape(out) + tm_polygons(col = "count") + tm_shape(Yelp_in_Geom)  + tm_dots()

## OK Now we are ready to join back the counts of Yoga Studios to the Tract data
FD_tract_Geom_yoga <- FD_tract_Geom %>%
  left_join(out %>% st_set_geometry(NULL), by = "GEOID")
```

# Make sure that the final dataset we will be using for our analysis is as expected

```{r}
skim(FD_tract_Geom_yoga)
tm_shape(FD_tract_Geom_yoga) + tm_polygons(col="count") +tm_shape(Yelp_in_Geom) +tm_dots()
```

# Let's clean up the data and drop the "NA"s for important variables like househiold income and real estate taxes

```{r}
## Now we have the file to work with (I hope!) Let's check again

print(skim(FD_tract_Geom_yoga))

# Dropping the missing values
yoga_census_dropnaHH2 <- FD_tract_Geom_yoga[!is.na(FD_tract_Geom_yoga$hhincome),]

# Just to check whether the 8 NAs have been dropped from hhincome
print(skim(yoga_census_dropnaHH2))

# What about the missing values of med_RETaxes? Let's get rid of those NAs too

y_census_dropnaHHTX <- yoga_census_dropnaHH2[!is.na(yoga_census_dropnaHH2$med_RETaxes),]
skim(y_census_dropnaHHTX)

# To check if it is still a sf file
class(y_census_dropnaHHTX)

```

## Now we are ready to ask some probing questions about the data
1. Are yoga studios in places with high median household incomes?

We could use the following ggplot command.

```{r}
ggplot(y_census_dropnaHHTX, aes(x=hhincome, y=count)) +
  geom_point() +
  ylab("Number of Yoga Studios and Household Median Income in Tract")
```

# How about we just look at a binary field that shows the presence or absence of Yoga Studios in tract?

```{r}
y_census_dropnaHHTX$Yoga <- ifelse(y_census_dropnaHHTX$count>0, 1, 0)
```

# A better way to visualize this categorical variable is a "boxplot"

```{r}
boxplot(hhincome~Yoga, data=y_census_dropnaHHTX, main="Boxplot of Yoga Studios by Income", xlab="Whether Yoga Studios are present", ylab="Household median income")
```
# What about a similat boxplot with Real Estate Taxes?
```{r}
boxplot(med_RETaxes~Yoga, data=y_census_dropnaHHTX, main="Boxplot of Yoga Studios by Real Estate Taxes", xlab="Whether Yoga Studios are present", ylab="Real Estate Taxes in tract")
```

## Finally, let's try a binary logistic regression

```{r}
binary_Yoga1 <- glm(Yoga~hhincome, family=binomial, data=y_census_dropnaHHTX)
summary(binary_Yoga1)

binary_Yoga2 <- glm(Yoga~med_RETaxes, family=binomial, data=y_census_dropnaHHTX)
summary(binary_Yoga2)
```

# So what do you think about our initial question? Are Yoga Studios associated with gentrified neighborhoods?
# As an exercise, download the data on median rents and examine if there is an association of yoga studios with median rents.

```
