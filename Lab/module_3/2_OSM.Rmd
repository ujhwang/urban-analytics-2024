# What is Open Street Map

Open Street Map (OSM) is a "collaborative project to create a free
editable geographic database of the world"
([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenStreetMap)). OSM is free
and has been adapted widely in academia as a reliable source of data.
OSM provides various types of data, ranging from raster map tiles to
geographic features in vector forms. We will focus on the vector data.

**Overview**

This document will walk to you through:

-   How to download OSM vector data.
-   How to convert the cleaned geometry vectors into a network.
-   How to calculate centrality measures.
-   How to do route finding (shortest path).

## Downloading the data

We will first define the bounding box within which we will get OSM data
using `nominatimlite` package. It uses the Nominatim API which is a geocoding service that powers the official OSM site. We used to get Census city boundary using `tigris` package, but since we are learning OSM, we can get the city boundary from OSM as well. Of course, you can create your own bounding box - we do it a few code chunks below.

```{r}
# Get bounding box coordinates for Atlanta
bb <- nominatimlite::geo_lite_sf('Atlanta, GA', points_only = F) %>% 
  st_bbox()

bb_sf <- bb %>% st_as_sfc()

## Plot-- 
tmap_mode('view')
tm_shape(bb_sf) + tm_borders()
```

[OSM wiki](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Map_features) states that
OMS represents physical features on the ground using **tags** attached
to its basic data structures (i.e., nodes, ways, and relations).
Although there can be infinite number of attributes (i.e., tags)
describing each feature, there are some **key-value** pairs that are
agreed upon by the community and are widely used. Although it might not
be accurate description, but thinking the **key** as a category and
**value** as entries within the category would be reasonably accurate
description. Some of the widely used keys include Amenity, Buildings,
Highway, and Shop. Then there are values attached to each of the key.
For Amenity, there are education, transportation, financial, healthcare,
and entertainment, etc.

For Highway (which means road in OSM), the followings are some examples
of the values:

-   motorway
-   trunk
-   primary
-   secondary
-   tertiary
-   residential
-   various links, including motorway_link, trunk_link, primary_link,
    etc.

For the full list of the key-pair values, please refer to
[OSMwiki](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/). To download all possible
key:value pairs for highway, you can insert `available_tags("highway")`
instead of manually specifying a list of values. One caveat is that,
using all available tags will generate a large data, significantly
slowing down the processing speed. Here, we download seven values under
key = 'highway' and convert it into sf format. The last function in the
code below, `osm_poly2line()` is added because "Street networks
downloaded with add_osm_object(key ="highway") will store any circular
highways in osm_polygons. this function combines those with the
osm_lines component to yield a single sf data.frame of all highways,
whether polygonal or not"
([source](https://rdrr.io/cran/osmdata/man/osm_poly2line.html)).

```{r}
# Get OSM road data
osm_road <- opq(bbox = bb) %>%
  add_osm_feature(key = 'highway', 
                  value = c("motorway", "motorway_link",
                            "trunk", "trunk_link", 
                            "primary", "primary_link",
                            "secondary", "secondary_link",
                            "tertiary", "residential")) %>%
  osmdata_sf() %>% 
  osm_poly2line()

names(osm_road)
```

This object `osm_road` is a list that has multiple elements, including
bbox, osm_points, osm_lines, osm_polygons, etc. We can extract
`osm_lines` and see what it looks like. The `prop.table()` function
below shows that 'residential' tag is roughly 70%.

```{r}
## Plot--
tmap_mode('plot')
tm_shape(osm_road$osm_lines) + tm_lines(col = "highway")
```

```{r}
# Breakdown of highway types
round(prop.table(table(osm_road$osm_lines$highway)) * 100, 1)
```

## Defining a custom bounding box

Displaying the entire network we just downloaded can slow down R
environment. For class exercise (for students to be able to follow
along), we will limit the bounding box to a smaller area. We will create
a custom bbox using coordinates of our selection. This technique of
generating your own bounding box can also be useful if you have a
specific area of interest that doesn't overlap well with commonly used
boundaries.

You need to define two points for bounding box, one point at the lower
left corner and the other at the upper right corner. You can go to
Google Maps, right-click on a point on map, and copy the XY coordinate.
Let's store them in `p1` and `p2`. Notice that Google Maps will give you
YX coords, but we need `p1` and `p2` in XY format.

```{r}
# p1 is lower left corner, p2 is the upper right corner
p1 <- c(-84.42138164090896, 33.729724924925925)
p2 <- c( -84.34372362786227, 33.79761117884929)
```

You will then need to format the two coordinates into the following
format. Then, let's convert it into sf object.

```{r}
# Custom BB
my_bb <- c(st_point(p1) %>% st_sfc(crs = 4326), 
           st_point(p2) %>% st_sfc(crs = 4326)) %>% st_bbox()

# Custom BB to sf
my_bb_sf <- my_bb %>% st_as_sfc()


# Extract a smaller network for exercise purpose
osm_small <- osm_road$osm_lines[my_bb_sf,] %>% select(osm_id, highway)

## Plot--
tmap_mode('view')
tm_shape(bb_sf) + tm_borders(col = "black") +  # Black = larger bbox
  tm_shape(my_bb_sf) + tm_borders(col = "red") +  # Red = smaller bbox
  tm_shape(osm_small) + tm_lines(col = "black") # Black line = small network
```

# Converting OSM data into network using `sfnetworks` package

Now we have OSM network geometry. This network geometry, however, has
many issues that need to be resolved before it can be used for analysis.
We will use `sfnetworks` package to do both cleaning and analysis. We
can pass `osm_small` to **as_sfnetwork()** to convert it to sfnetwork
object. It is important to note that the sf object you pass to
**as_sfnetwork()** function should be *LINESTRING*. When using
**as_sfnetwork()**, it creates a directed network by default. For
simplicity, we will set this to FALSE.

You can see that the output `net` object has two parts:
**nodes** and **edges**. Also notice that the node data is denoted as
'active'. The sfnetworks objects is made of nodes and edges that connect
the nodes. When you do data manipulation using, for example, dplyr verbs
such as mutate, you can choose whether to apply it to nodes or edges by
**activating** the one that you want to modify.

```{r}
# Converting the line component of OSM data into a network
net <- sfnetworks::as_sfnetwork(osm_small, directed = FALSE)
print(net)
print(paste0('Which one is active?: ', sfnetworks::active(net)))
```

You can also extract nodes and edges as separate sf objects using
**st_as_sf()** function. To extract sf objects representing edges and
nodes and store them separately, you can do (1)
`net %>% activate("nodes") %>% st_as_sf()` or, equivalently, (2)
`net %>% st_as_sf("nodes")`. The result is the same. In the leaflet()
function below which takes `sf` objects but not `sfnetworks` objects,
you need to extract nodes and edges separately and pass the extraction.
The yellow points are nodes and gray lines are edges.

```{r}
## Plot--
leaflet() %>% 
  addProviderTiles(providers$CartoDB.DarkMatter) %>% 
  setView( -84.3854, 33.7618, zoom = 13) %>% 
  addPolylines(data = net %>% st_as_sf('edges'), 
               col = "gray", 
               weight = 3, 
               opacity = 0.9, 
               popup = net %>% st_as_sf('edges') %>% pull(osm_id)) %>% 
    addCircles(data = net %>% st_as_sf('nodes'), 
               fillColor = 'yellow', 
               stroke = F, 
               radius = 20, 
               fillOpacity = 0.7) 
```

# Cleaning network

## Simplifying network

| This content is heavily based on [this sfnetwork tutorial](https://luukvdmeer.github.io/sfnetworks/articles/sfn02_preprocess_clean.html)

A network data may contain edges that connect the same pair of nodes,
called *multiple edges*. There can also be loops that starts and ends at
the same node (e.g., think of a cul-de-sac). The former case can be
detected using `edge_is_multiple()` and the latter using
`edge_is_loop()`.

When removing a set of multiple edges using functions shown below, they
always keep the first edge and discard others. By arranging the order of
edges for each set of multiple edges, you can specify which edge you
want to preserve.

This way of simplification means that, when the multiple edges within a
set have different attributes, all attribute information except for the
preserved one would be lost. In such cases, you can *merge* those edges.
Then, the output would have the geometry of the first edge in the set,
but the attributes would be some summary of all the edges in the set.
`to_spatial_simple()` function does this work (but not used in this
document).

```{r}
# Let's simplify our network
simple_net <- net %>%
  activate("edges") %>%
  filter(!edge_is_multiple()) %>%
  filter(!edge_is_loop()) 

# Because the difference is not really discernible, we just print out the differences in the edge count.
message(str_c("Before simplification, there were ", net %>% st_as_sf("edges") %>% nrow(), " edges. \n",
            "After simplification, there are ", simple_net %>% st_as_sf("edges") %>% nrow(), " edges."))
```

## Subdivide edges

**Why subdivide?**

When `as_sfnetwork()` function converts an sf linestrings, the nodes are
defined as the *endpoints* of each linestring. If you zoom into Midtown
in the map above, there are many edges that crosses (i.e.,
intersections) but do not have nodes. The absence of nodes at what
appears to be intersections would be legitimate data if the two crossing
roads are, for example, bridges that have different elevations. However,
we anecdotally know that there aren't that many such overhead bridges in
our study area.

We can use `to_spatial_subdivision` predicate to create points at the
intersections and cut the edges accordingly.

> "Construct a subdivision of the network by subdividing edges at each
> interior point that is equal to any other interior or boundary point
> in the edges table. Interior points in this sense are those points
> that are included in their linestring geometry feature but are not
> endpoints of it, while boundary points are the endpoints of the
> linestrings. The network is reconstructed after subdivision such that
> edges are connected at the points of subdivision."
> ([source](https://luukvdmeer.github.io/sfnetworks/reference/spatial_morphers.html))

This `to_spatial_subdivision` function is a part of functions called
[spatial
morphers](https://luukvdmeer.github.io/sfnetworks/reference/spatial_morphers.html).
Morphers are rooted in tidygraph, which allows you to temporarily morph
the topology of the original network, do some work to the "morphed
state" of the network, and merge the results back to the original
network using unmorph() (See [this
document](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/sfnetworks/vignettes/sfn05_morphers.html)
from which I borrowed heavily). <font color=pink> It is by design that
morphers are used not directly but by passing them to `morph()`
function. </font>

Although morphing is meant to be temporary, we can also make the changes
**permanent** by passing them to `convert()` function instead of
`morph()` function because we want to make permanent changes to our
network (i.e., create nodes at intersections), we will use `convert()`.

```{r}
# # Using spatial morpher
subdiv_net <- convert(simple_net, sfnetworks::to_spatial_subdivision)

# -------------------------------------------
# Below is done for visualization purpose
subdiv_net <- subdiv_net %>% 
  activate("nodes") %>% 
  mutate(custom_id = seq(1, subdiv_net %>% st_as_sf("nodes") %>% nrow()),
         is.new = case_when(is.na(.tidygraph_node_index) ~ "new nodes",
                            TRUE ~ "existing nodes"),
         is.new = factor(is.new)) 

## Plot--
subdiv_pal <- colorFactor(palette = c("yellow", "red"), domain = subdiv_net %>% st_as_sf("nodes") %>% pull(is.new))

subdiv_map <- leaflet() %>% 
  addProviderTiles(providers$CartoDB.DarkMatter) %>% 
  setView( -84.3854, 33.7618, zoom = 13) %>%
  addPolylines(data = subdiv_net %>% st_as_sf('edges'), col = "grey", weight = 3, opacity = 0.9) %>% 
  addCircles(data = subdiv_net %>% st_as_sf('nodes'), fillColor = ~subdiv_pal(is.new), stroke = F, radius = 20, fillOpacity = 0.7) %>% 
  addLegend(position = "bottomright", pal = subdiv_pal, values = subdiv_net %>% st_as_sf("nodes") %>% pull(is.new)) 

subdiv_map
```

## Delete pseudo nodes

Notice that there are nodes on edges that are unnecessary nodes called
pseudo nodes. For directed networks, pseudo nodes are those that have
only one incoming and one outgoing edge. For undirected networks, pseudo
nodes are those that have two incident edges. If these edges connected
by these pseudo nodes are identical in their attributes, these nodes are
unnecessary in any ways. These nodes can be delete using
**to_spatial_smooth** predicate.

```{r}
# Using spatial morpher
smoothed_net <- convert(subdiv_net, sfnetworks::to_spatial_smooth)

# -------------------------------------------
# Below is done for visualization purpose
# Extract removed points for mapping purposes
removed <- setdiff(subdiv_net %>% st_as_sf('nodes') %>% pull(custom_id), 
                   smoothed_net %>% st_as_sf('nodes') %>% pull(custom_id))

smooth_map <- leaflet() %>% 
  addProviderTiles(providers$CartoDB.DarkMatter) %>% 
  setView( -84.3854, 33.7618, zoom = 13) %>%
  addPolylines(data = smoothed_net %>% st_as_sf('edges'), col = "grey", weight = 3, opacity = 0.9, popup = smoothed_net %>% st_as_sf('edges') %>% rownames()) %>% 
    addCircles(data = smoothed_net %>% st_as_sf('nodes'), fillColor = 'yellow', stroke = F, radius = 20, fillOpacity = 0.7, group = "kept") %>% 
    addCircles(data = subdiv_net %>% st_as_sf("nodes") %>% filter(custom_id %in% removed), 
               fillColor = "red", stroke = F, radius = 15, fillOpacity = 0.4, group = "removed") %>% 
  addControl(html = htmltools::HTML("<b>Red points denote removed nodes</b>"), position = "bottomright") %>% 
  addLayersControl(overlayGroups = c("kept", "removed"))

smooth_map
```

# Calculate centrality

One of the most common ways for analyzing the characteristics of
networks are centrality measures. These algorithms assigns some numbers
to nodes within a graph based on their position in the given network.
There are many centrality measures, each with their own characteristics,
as illustrated in the images below. We will try betweenness centrality
and degree centrality. 
  
Betweenness centrality measures "the percentage
of shortest paths that must go through the specific node ([Golbeck 2005,
p.229](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780128016565000214))".
  
Degree centrality is the simplest centrality measure to compute: it is a
count of how many connections a node has ([Golbeck 2005,
p.226](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780128016565000214)).

![](centrality.jpg) (Source: Figure 1 in [Cordeiro et al.
(2018)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.02960v1))

## Betweenness centrality

```{r}
# Calculate centrality measures
network_char <- smoothed_net %>% 
  activate("edges") %>%
  mutate(weight = edge_length()) %>% 
  mutate(edge_bc = centrality_edge_betweenness(weights = weight, directed = F)) %>%
  activate("nodes") %>% 
  mutate(node_bc = centrality_betweenness(weights = weight, directed = F))

# Edge betweenness
bet_pal_edge <- colorNumeric(palette = "inferno", domain = network_char %>% activate("edges") %>% pull(edge_bc), n = 10)

# Node betweenness
bet_pal_node <- colorNumeric(palette = "inferno", domain = network_char %>% activate("nodes") %>% pull(node_bc), n = 10)


# Map
leaflet() %>% 
  addProviderTiles(providers$CartoDB.DarkMatter) %>%
  setView( -84.3854, 33.7618, zoom = 13) %>%
  addPolylines(data = network_char %>% st_as_sf("edges"), 
               color = ~bet_pal_edge(network_char %>% st_as_sf('edges') %>% pull(edge_bc)), weight = 3, opacity = 0.9) %>% 
  addCircles(data = network_char %>% st_as_sf("nodes"), 
               fillColor = ~bet_pal_node(network_char %>% st_as_sf('nodes') %>% pull(node_bc)), stroke = F, fillOpacity = 0.9, 
             radius = network_char %>% st_as_sf("nodes") %>% with(.$node_bc/(max(.$node_bc)/100))) # denominator is selected to make the max value roughly equal to 100
```
## Degree centrality

Intersections are used in various measures of the built environment. For
example, intersection density (number of intersections divided by the
area) is used to calculate a walkability index ([Frank et al.,
2005](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0749379704003253?casa_token=kHCOrJaK25UAAAAA:KQqIuoVNIpubIKO8q8cGSzkHSGZK_b-LYi6qd5wvcXxG3cftTdhgPZ6tpLV-1yxWKCla2_F0QA))
as well as in the well-known 5D framework ([Ewing and Cervero,
2010](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/01944361003766766)).
Remember that (unweighted) degree centrality simply means the number of
edges each node has. Because we have cleaned the network by dropping
pseudo nodes, the intersection would be those nodes with degree
centrality greater than 1.

```{r}

intersections <- smoothed_net %>%
  st_transform(crs = 4326) %>% 
  activate("nodes") %>% 
  mutate(degree = centrality_degree(weights = NULL)) %>% 
  filter(degree > 1)

color_palette <- colorFactor(
  palette = c("#878686", "#ffffff", "#ffed78", "#ff7878"),
  domain = intersections %>% st_as_sf("nodes") %>% .$degree
)

leaflet() %>% 
  addProviderTiles(providers$CartoDB.DarkMatter) %>% 
  setView( -84.3854, 33.7618, zoom = 13) %>%
  addPolylines(data = smoothed_net %>% st_as_sf('edges'), col = "grey", weight = 3, opacity = 0.9) %>% 
    addCircles(data = intersections %>% st_as_sf('nodes'), 
               fillColor = ~color_palette(degree), 
               stroke = F, 
               radius = ~degree * 10, 
               fillOpacity = 0.9)
```


## Shortest path

One of the most widely performed task with road networks is to find a
route between A and B, often the shortest path. IT can be easily done
using `sfnetworks` package's `st_network_paths()`.

First, you need to create sf objects with POINT geometry that represent
origin and destination. These points do not need to be ON the network -
the `sf_network_paths()` will find the nearest node and use them for the
calculation. You can also supply multiple destinations to a single call
of `st_network_paths()`, but the origin has to be the same. Then, you
can pass them to `st_network_paths()` along with the network. The output
is a data frame (a tibble to be more specific) with two columns,
node_paths and edge_paths. This data frame will have as many rows as the
number of origin-destination pairs. Opening up the content of the data
frame, you will notice that it is just a sequence of nodes and edges
through which the shortest path runs.

```{r}
# Change crs for convenience
smoothed_net <- smoothed_net %>% st_transform(4326)

# Start point
start_p <- nominatimlite::geo_lite_sf('Georgia Tech CRC') %>% st_geometry() # same as `pull(gemetry)`
# End point
target_p1 <- nominatimlite::geo_lite_sf('Atlanta Botanical Garden') %>% st_geometry()
target_p2 <- nominatimlite::geo_lite_sf('Krog Street Market') %>% st_geometry()

# Get the shortest path
paths <- st_network_paths(smoothed_net, from = start_p, to = c(target_p1, target_p2), type = "shortest")

# Extract shortest path
paths_sf1 <- smoothed_net %>%
  activate("nodes") %>% 
  slice(paths$node_paths[[1]])

paths_sf2 <- smoothed_net %>%
  activate("nodes") %>% 
  slice(paths$node_paths[[2]])


# Visualize
leaflet() %>% 
  addProviderTiles(providers$CartoDB.DarkMatter) %>% 
  setView( -84.3854, 33.7618, zoom = 13) %>%
  # Base network in grey
  addPolylines(data = smoothed_net %>% st_as_sf("edges"), color = 'grey', weight = 2, opacity = 0.7) %>% 
  
  # Chosen edges
  addPolylines(data = paths_sf1 %>% st_as_sf("edges"), color = "pink", weight = 10, opacity = 0.3) %>% 
  # Chosen nodes
  addCircles(data = paths_sf1 %>% st_as_sf("nodes"), stroke = F, fillColor = "pink", fillOpacity = 0.8, radius = 50) %>% 
  
  # Chosen edges
  addPolylines(data = paths_sf2 %>% st_as_sf("edges"), color = "lightgreen", weight = 10, opacity = 0.3) %>% 
  # Chosen nodes
  addCircles(data = paths_sf2 %>% st_as_sf("nodes"), stroke = F, fillColor = "lightgreen", fillOpacity = 0.8, radius = 50)

```


# Using GTFS and OSM together

Although GTFS and OSM are different data sources and may seem to reside
in totally separate world, people in the real world frequently mix the
two as they navigate in a city. For example, one might drive from home
to the nearest MARTA rail transit station, park their car there, and
ride transit to their work. To analyze such movement, we need to be able
to somehow connect the two datasets.

For exercise, let's examine how to compute the shortest path from one
location to MARTA rail stations. Since we are only interested in rail
stations, we first need to extract transit stops for rail. As we
discussed last week, GTFS is a relational table. The information on
whether a transit facility is for bus or rail is contained in `routes`
table, but it is not possible to link `stops` table and `routes` table
directly. We will join routes -\> trips -\> stop_times -\> stops. Then,
we will extract the *stop_id* of rail stations.

```{r}
# Read GTFS
transit <- tidytransit::read_gtfs("https://www.itsmarta.com/google_transit_feed/google_transit.zip") %>% 
  tidytransit::gtfs_as_sf()

# Get stop_id for rails
rail_stops <- transit$routes %>% 
  filter(route_type %in% c(0,1,2)) %>% 
  inner_join(transit$trips, by = "route_id") %>% 
  inner_join(transit$stop_times, by = "trip_id") %>% 
  inner_join(transit$stops, by = "stop_id") %>% 
  group_by(stop_id) %>% 
  slice(1) %>% 
  pull(stop_id)

tm_shape(transit$stops %>% filter(stop_id %in% rail_stops)) + tm_dots(col = "red")
```

Now, we need the city-wide OSM network that we downloaded at the
beginning.

```{r}
# Using the full network file 
atl_net <- osm_road$osm_lines %>%
  select(osm_id, highway) %>% 
  sfnetworks::as_sfnetwork(directed = FALSE) %>% 
  activate("edges") %>%
  filter(!edge_is_multiple()) %>%
  filter(!edge_is_loop()) %>% 
  convert(., sfnetworks::to_spatial_subdivision) %>% 
  convert(., sfnetworks::to_spatial_smooth)
```

Next, the remaining steps are:

1.  Define the starting point.
2.  Define the ending points (which are MARTA rail stations).
3.  Fine the shortest paths from the starting point to all ending
    points (i.e., stations).
4.  Calculate the distance of each route between the starting point to
    each MARTA rail stations.
5.  Replace those with 0 distances with some large number (e.g., maximum
    distance). These are those for which the algorithm could not find
    connecting routes.
6.  Find the one with the minimum distance.
7.  Map it!

```{r}
# Change crs for convenience
atl_net <- atl_net %>% st_transform(4326) %>% activate("edges") %>% mutate(length = edge_length())

# Step 1. Start point
start_p <- nominatimlite::geo_lite_sf("IKEA Atlanta") %>% st_geometry() # I chose IKEA

# Step 2. End point
rail_stops_point <- transit$stops %>% filter(stop_id %in% rail_stops) %>% st_geometry()

# Step 3. Get the shortest path
paths <- st_network_paths(atl_net, from = start_p, to = rail_stops_point, type = "shortest")

# Step 4. Find the distances
