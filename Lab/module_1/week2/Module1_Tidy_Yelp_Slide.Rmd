# Data are messy
When you read textbooks on statistics or online tutorials on Urban Analytics, they often use data that’s already nice and clean. They often do not show you all the hassle they went through to clean the data

--
### Unprocessed Data are messy and have all sorts of issues

--
For example:
--
<ol>
<li> Rows and columns do not represent observations and variables, respectively
<li> Duplicated or redundant rows/columns
<li> multiple variables in one column
<li> Missing data
<li> Unstructured data
</ol>
and the list goes on..

---
## Issue 1 - Rows and columns do not represent observations and variables

### The opposite of "messy" data is "tidy" data
--

.center[
In tidy data,

“Each variable must have its own column.”

“Each observation must have its own row.”

“Each value must have its own cell.”

(from Chapter 12.2 in R for Data Science)
]
--

- <font color=blue>You need to decide what is your "variable" and what is an individual "record"</font>
---
## Wide vs. Long forms
* **Wide**: each row represents a unique entity, and repeated measures or different variables are spread across columns.
* **Long**: each row represents a single observation, and each variable is in its own column.

```{r eval=F}
census_wide <- get_acs(geography="tract", 
                       state="GA", 
                       variables=c(hhincome='B19019_001', pop = "B02001_001"),
                       county="Fulton", 
                       year=2022, 
                       output="wide", #<<
                       geomtry=TRUE)
```

---
## Wide vs. Long forms

```{r, include=F, message=F, warning=F}
census_wide <- suppressMessages(
  get_acs(geography="tract", state="GA", variables=c(hhincome='B19019_001', pop = "B02001_001"), 
          county="Fulton", year=2022, output="wide", geomtry=TRUE))

census_long <- suppressMessages(
  get_acs(geography="tract", state="GA", variables=c(hhincome='B19019_001', pop = "B02001_001"), 
          county="Fulton", year=2022, geomtry=TRUE))
```
.small[
.pull-left[

with `output="wide"`:

```{r}
census_wide %>% 
  head() %>%  
  nice_table("350px")
```

.pull-right[
with `output="long"`:

```{r}

## Wide format is useful when
* Cross-sectional data
* Comparison between multiple variables
* Data export and reporting

| student | math_score | science_score |
|---------|------------|---------------|
|   A     |   100      |  90           |
|   B     |   85       |  80           |
|   C     |   90       |  85           |
|   D     |   98       |  95           |
|   E     |   50       |  60           |
|   F     |   70       |  40           |


---
## Long format is useful when
* Time series data
* Repeated measures of experiments
* Grouped data

| store |   month    |   sales |
|-------|------------|---------|
| A     |   Jan      |  500    |
| A     |   Feb      |  300    |
| A     |   Mar      |  500    |
| B     |   Feb      |  200    |
| B     |   Jan      |  450    |
| B     |   Mar      |  600    |

## Wide -> Long

.small[
```{r}
longer <- census_wide %>% 
  pivot_longer(cols = hhincomeE:popM, # Cols to be affected
               names_to = c("variable"), # Name for the label column
               values_to = c("value")) # Name for the value column
longer
```
]

---
## Long -> Wide

.small[
```{r}
wider <- longer %>% 
  pivot_wider(id_cols = c(GEOID, NAME), 
              names_from = c("variable"),
              values_from = c("value")) 
wider
```

## Issue 2 - Duplicated rows/columns

* Duplicated rows is a common issue when using API to acquire data
* Most frequently used functions to deal with duplicates include:
  * duplicated() and distinct()

```{r}
dupl_df <- data.frame(name = c("A", "A", "B", "C", "C", "C", "D"),
                      GPA = c(3.5, 3.5, 4.0, 2.0, 3.0, 3.0, 2.0)) 
duplicated(dupl_df$name)
```

---
## Issue 2 - Duplicated rows/columns
### !duplicated()

```{r}
# Duplicates in column "name" removed.
dupl_df[!duplicated(dupl_df$name),]
```

```{r}
dupl_df[!duplicated(dupl_df),]
```


---
## Issue 2 - Duplicated rows/columns
### `dplyr::distinct()`

```{r}
# Returns a vector, not data frame
dupl_df %>% 
  distinct(name) # Try adding .keep_all = TRUE argument 
```

```{r}
# Returns a data frame
dupl_df %>% 
  distinct(name, GPA)
```

---
## Issue 3 - Multiple variables in one column
### Case 1. different variables can be concatenated into a long string

* A very common example from Census data: you often find something like <b>Census Tract 9501, Appling County, Georgia</b> in a single column
* It contains at least three variables: Tract, County, and State
* We can break the string down into pieces using `separate()` from `tidyr` package or `str_split_fixed()` from `stringr` package.

---
## Issue 3 - Multiple variables in one column
### `tidyr::separate()`

```{r}
# A character vector to split
onecol_df <- data.frame(labels = c('a1','b_2','c_3_2','d_4_1'))
# split the character at _
onecol_df_separate <- onecol_df %>% 
  separate(col = "labels", 
           sep = "_",
           into = c("alphabet", "number1", "number2")) 

print(onecol_df_separate)
```

---
## Issue 3 - Multiple variables in one column
### `stringr::str_split_fixed()`

```{r}
onecol_df_split <- str_split_fixed(onecol_df$labels,
                                   pattern = "_", 
                                   n = 3)

print(onecol_df_split)
```


---
## Issue 3 - Multiple variables in one column
### Case 2. a column in a data frame contains another data frame, list, or dictionary

.small[
.pull-left[
* This case is frequently found when we convert JSON, which can have nested structure, into a data frame.
* In such cases you need to <font color=blue>flatten</font> the data frame using jsonlite::flatten() which will automatically generate columns that concatenate the name of the column with the nested columns inside.
* Even after flattening, there could be list-columns remaining. These will have to be addressed individually according to your needs.

## Issue 3 - Multiple variables in one column
### JSON example

```{r}
jsonlite::fromJSON("json_example.json") %>% .$orders %>% sapply(class)

```
```{r}
jsonlite::fromJSON("json_example.json", flatten = T) %>% .$orders %>% sapply(class)
```


---
## Issue 4 - Missing Values
* In R, NA is used to represent missing data 
* Many core functions in R does not work properly when NA is in the vector, so those values should be taken care of.

```{r}
avg <- mean(c(NA, 10, 25, 3))
avg
```

---
## Issue 4 - Missing Values
### How to deal with missing values

* Deletion
  * Listwise
  * Pairwise
  * Dropping a variable

* Imputation/interpolation

---
## Issue 4 - Missing Values
### Listwise deletion

* Removes all data for a case that has one or more missing values.
```{r echo=F}
data <- data.frame(
  student = c("A", "B", "C", "D", "E", "F"),
  math_score = c(100, 85, NA, 98, 50, 70),
  science_score = c(90, 80, 85, 95, 60, 65),
  english_score = c(75, 100, NA, 40, 100, 40)
)

data %>%
  kbl() %>%
  kable_styling() %>%
  row_spec(3, background = "yellow")
```

---
## Issue 4 - Missing Values
### Pairwise deletion
* Attempts to minimize the loss that occurs in listwise deletion. 
```{r echo=F}
data <- data.frame(
  student = c("A", "B", "C", "D", "E", "F"),
  math_score = c(100, 85, 90, NA, 50, 70),
  science_score = c(90, 80, 85, 95, 60, NA),
  english_score = c(75, 100, NA, 40, 100, 40)
)

data %>%
  mutate(
    math_score = ifelse(is.na(math_score), cell_spec(math_score, background = "yellow"), math_score),
    science_score = ifelse(is.na(science_score), cell_spec(science_score, background = "yellow"), science_score),
    english_score = ifelse(is.na(english_score), cell_spec(english_score, background = "yellow"), english_score)
  ) %>%
  kbl(escape = FALSE) %>%  
  kable_styling()
```

---
## Issue 4 - Missing Values
### Dropping a variable

* Discard a variable that is missing for a large portion of the observations.
```{r echo=F}
data <- data.frame(
  student = c("A", "B", "C", "D", "E", "F"),
  math_score = c(100, 85, 90, 98, 50, 70),
  science_score = c(90, 80, 85, 95, 60, 65),
  english_score = c(75, 100, NA, NA, NA, 40)
)

data %>%
  kbl() %>%
  kable_styling() %>%
  column_spec(4, background = "yellow") 
```

---
## Issue 4 - Missing Values
### Imputation/interpolation
.small[
* Imputation
  * Mean, median, mode, or other statistical methods like KNN
  * **No specific assumptions about data continuity**
* Interpolation
  * Linear, polynomial, or spline interpolation
  * **Assumes some continuity and smooth transition between data points**

```{r echo=F}
data <- data.frame(
  student = c("A", "B", "C", "D", "E", "F"),
  math_score = c(100, 85, 90, 98, 50, 70),
  science_score = c(90, 80, NA, 95, 60, 65),
  english_score = c(75, 100, 70, 40, 100, 40)
)

data %>%
  kbl() %>%
  kable_styling() %>%
  column_spec(3, background = "yellow")
```
]
---
## Issue 4 - Missing Values
### Listwise deletion: `is.na()`

* is.na() is a Base R function that returns a logical object (TRUE/FALSE)
```{r}
toy_df <- data.frame(name = c("John", "Jane", "Mary", "Bob"), 
                     treatment_a = c(NA, 16, 3, 5),
                     treatment_b = c(2, 11, 1, NA),
                     treatment_c = c(6, 12, NA, 2))

# Dropping NA using is.na()
toy_df %>% 
  filter(!is.na(treatment_a))
```

---
## Issue 4 - Missing Values
### Listwise deletion: `tidyr::drop_na()`

* drop_na() is part of the tidyr package that drops rows with NAs in the specified column(s)
```{r}
toy_df %>% 
  drop_na(treatment_a, treatment_b)
```

```{r}
# This check across all columns and drops all rows that have at least one NA.
toy_df %>% 
  drop_na()
```

---
## Anonymous function

.small[
* When using **apply()** or **map()**, you can provide an existing or a custom-made function.
* Similar to lambda in Python, R has anonymous function. 
* Anonymous function is **a function defined on the fly and disappears after execution.**

.pull-left[
```{r}
map(1:5, # input vector
    function(x) x + 1) # anonymous function
```
]

.pull-right[
```{r}
map(1:5, # input vector
    function(x){ # anonymous function with {}
      out <- (x + 1)*x
      return(out)
    })
```
]
]

---
## Anonymous function

.small[
* map() and other variants has a nice syntax that make the code simple. 
* Instead of declaring `function(x)`, you can use a tilde (~) to indicate that it is anonymous function.
* `x`s inside the anonymous function needs to be preceded by a period (.). See the example below.

```{r}
map(1:5, # input
    ~(.x + 1)*.x ) # tilde replaces function().  # x is preceded by a period
```
]

---
## Existing data frame into a sf object
* You can convert a data frame with lng/lat into a sf object. This can be done using **st_as_sf()**. 
* The word 'as' indicates that it converts an *existing* object to sf rather than creating one from scratch.

.pull-left[
```{r eval=F}
# A data frame with XY info
point_df <- data.frame(
  x = c(-84.3991, -84.4010, -84.3899), 
  y = c(33.7770, 33.7748, 33.7777))

# st_as_sf
point_sf <- point_df %>% 
  st_as_sf(coords = c("x", "y"), 
           crs = 4326)

tm_shape(point_sf) + tm_dots()
```
]

.pull-right[
```{r, echo=F, out.width="100%"}
# A data frame with XY info
point_df <- data.frame(
  x = c(-84.3991, -84.4010, -84.3899), 
  y = c(33.7770, 33.7748, 33.7777))

# st_as_sf
point_sf <- point_df %>% 
  st_as_sf(coords = c("x", "y"), 
           crs = 4326)

tm_shape(point_sf) + tm_dots()
```
]

## Detecting string - str_detect/grepl

* Some may download two Yelp categories at once.
* Rows for category A and B will be mixed.
* To count how many As and Bs are there respectively, you need to search strings.

grepl(.red[pattern], .blue[string])
```{r}
a <- c("yoga studio", "health gym", "pizza", "YoGa")
grepl("yoga", a)
```

str_detect(.blue[string], .red[pattern])
```{r}
str_detect(a, "yoga")
```
